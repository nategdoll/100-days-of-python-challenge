            print("You got it")

# Describe the problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing? It is checking i from 1-19 and printing if i is 20.
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"? it is meant to print it at the end but never will because it only goes up to 19 and not 20.
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i? The assumption is that i is an integer in the range of 1 to 19.
