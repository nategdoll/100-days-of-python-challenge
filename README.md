# 100-days-of-python-challenge
I am working on the Master Python in 100 Days challenge on Udemy

Even though I have already been working on Python for years it has been about 2 years since I used it professionally.
So I decided in my free time it wouldn't hurt to brush up a bit.

Before starting I created a generate_folders.py file that would generate folders for all 100 days, while also grouping them by 10.

I will say that I am in no way adhering to the every day for 100 days, but I am completing between 3-5 a week so far.

This is to just polish up my skills reafirm the basics and work towards becoming an expert in my favorite language.

Thanks to anyone who reads :-) I hope you enjoy!
